# OurHouse
Our House is a status tracking app for members of a common home. 
Family members or flatmates can keep each other updated on their current availability by toggling unique status options. 

Like many others, I started working from home due to COVID. My company mainly used Skype, while my partners company used Slack. We never really knew when it was okay to check-in throughout the day. I found that many people were probably experiencing something similiar. Whether you're a college student watching zoom lectures, or a parent on call- everyones using a different medium setup by their company or school. OurHouse is a way to integrate these technologies in a simple no-fuss way. Simply setup your most common status such as 'In a lecture' or 'On a call' and update your housemates to avoid those uncomfortable mid-presentation knocks.
